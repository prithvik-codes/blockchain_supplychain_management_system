# blockchain_supplychain_management_system
This project is a Blockchain-powered Supply Chain Traceability System that enables secure tracking and verification of products across different stages of the supply chain. Each product entry generates a unique QR code, allowing end-users to scan and verify product authenticity, origin, and lifecycle history through a blockchain ledger.
